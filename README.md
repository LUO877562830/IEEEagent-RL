# IEEEagent-RL
IEEEagent RL is a summary and notes about reinforcement learning algorithms

The purpose of this document is to communicate and learn from how to industrial control with reinforcement learning 

1. build myself RL environment on OpenAI gym (in main files [Myenvs])
2. build myself Pybullet envs  (in Branches flies [Pybullet-envs])
